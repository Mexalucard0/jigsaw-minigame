# jigsaw-minigame

This is a standalone script for Fivem servers.

Use /saw to start the game

- A video will be displayed on every player screen.
- It will spawn a reverse bear trap on everyone.
- They will need to find the code before the time ends or they will explode.
- You can change the code and use whatever minigame you wish, on this example I used mhacking from GHMatti.


Requeriments:
- MHacking: https://github.com/GHMatti/FiveM-Scripts
- Add your steamhex on server.lua
- Change the revive function on client.lua line 70
